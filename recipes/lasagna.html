    <h2 class="titles">Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna, the ultimate comfort food, is a symphony of flavor and texture born in Italy. Layers of wide, flat pasta embrace rich ragù, a meaty tango of simmered tomatoes and ground beef, pork, or sausage. Creamy béchamel, a white sauce whispered with butter and flour, adds smooth richness. Then, a chorus of cheeses - gooey mozzarella, delicate ricotta, and salty Parmesan - melts into gooey perfection. Vegetables sometimes join the party, adding pops of color and texture.</p>
    <p>This Italian masterpiece requires patience and love. Each layer is lovingly prepped, stacked, and bathed in fire's embrace. As it bubbles and browns, the air sings with intoxicating aromas. From Neapolitan versions with meatballs and eggs to Bolognese variations showcasing exquisite ragù, lasagna offers endless possibilities. Whether you embrace tradition or explore plant-based twists, let yourself be swept away by its layered delights. It's a warm hug on a cold day, a celebration shared, and a love story written in every cheesy, delicious bite.</p>

    <h2 class="titles">Steps for a tasty lasagna</h2>
    <div>
            <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>Make the Meat Sauce: Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until softened, then add garlic and cook for another minute. Brown the meat, breaking it up with a spoon. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, wine (if using), oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Make the Béchamel Sauce: Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook for 1 minute. Gradually whisk in warm milk until smooth and thickened. Stir in Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Assemble the Lasagna: Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Top with lasagna noodles, then spread with a mixture of ricotta cheese and beaten egg. Add another layer of meat sauce, noodles, and then béchamel sauce. Repeat layering until all ingredients are used, finishing with noodles, béchamel sauce, and both mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.</li>
            <li>Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until bubbly and golden brown on top. Let cool for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
